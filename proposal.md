# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name: Angelina Olmedo **


**Project Name: Dig Dig Dogs!**


**Is your project New or Old?** Old


**Is your project Solo or Team?** Solo


## Description

This project was started during the winter intensive and a viable skateboard with the main mechanic— clicking dogs to generate resources—accomplished. During this intensive I hope to expand on the secondary function of the game, which is the ability to use resources to upgrade dogs. It is also important to me to get inventory/user persistence working, as a big function of the game is the ability to build off of what you've already done.

## Challenges I Anticipate

I am still not as comfortable as I'd like to be with Xcode or Swift, so I definitely anticipate most of my issues will arise from my inexperience. I do, however, know much more than I did during the winter intensive, and thus anticipate that further issues may arise when trying to update my older code to be more consistent with what I know now.  

## Skateboard

Resources may be exchanged for higher-level dogs. These dogs are not available until unlocked.

## Bike

Global UI updates to use constraints rather than hardcoded positions, and compatibility for differently sized screens. Particular attention should be paid to the screen for selecting and upgrading dogs, where users should be able to scroll to see additional dogs. Inventory page should be updated similarly.

## Car

Items/resources/user info persist between sessions of the game. This includes CRUDing users.

## Personal Achievement Goals:

1. Add function: exchange resources for better dogs
1. UI Updates
1. Information persistence
