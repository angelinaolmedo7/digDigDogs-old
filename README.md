# Dig, Dig, Dogs!
Dig, Dig, Dogs! is a work-in-progress IOS app that features cute dogs digging for resources, which can then be spent on upgrades. The project will ultimately be released as a free-to-play idle game on the app store. For now, it is under development and free to download in its unfinished state as an Xcode project.
## Getting Started
To play the latest version of the game, clone this repo and run an iPhone simulator as instructed:
### Prerequisites
Xcode 10+

Swift 5+

### Installing
Clone this repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/angelinaolmedo7/digDigDogs
